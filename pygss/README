Compiling

First, you will need to obtain MIT Kerberos V5-1.1. from 
ftp://athena-dist.mit.edu/pub/kerberos/  Regrettably, I
don't feel up to providing this for you myself, or for providing
binaries of this python module.  Also, you will need SWIG 
(http://www.swig.org) in order to produce new C wrapper code if you plan
to modify the SWIG interface file.  If not, you can simply use the
wrapper code as-is.

Testing

You will want to change the default values in the client.py and
server.py scripts to reflect your local setup (i.e. principal names,
realm name, etc.)

You will need to set up a KDC, and extract a service principal for your
host to the /etc/krb5.keytab file.  Refer to the MIT kerberos
documentation for instructions on how to do this.  The user running the
server application will have to have read access to this file.  For the
client, you will need to obtain a ticket granting ticket (TGT) prior to
running the client application, or it will complain about being unable
to obtain credentials.  


Good luck,
